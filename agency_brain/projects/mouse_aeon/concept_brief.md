# Concept Brief: Aeon Mouse

## 1. The Design Concept: "Sculpted Air"
Inspired by the feeling of holding a smooth river stone. The Aeon Mouse is a semi-vertical design to balance tradition with ergonomics (as found in trend research).

## 2. Key Features (Agent Decisions)
- **Trend Alignment**: Incorporating a "Handshake" grip at a 57-degree angle (inspired by Logitech Lift popularity).
- **Control**: Using a hidden trackball under the thumb area for ultra-precision, masked by a flexible mesh.
- **Sophistication**: Minimalist exterior with no visible gaps. 3D-knitted fabric cover for warmth and grip.

## 3. Interaction Design (Intelligent/Ergonomic)
- **Primary Click**: Soft-touch capacitive sensors across the top shell.
- **Scrolling**: A touch-sensitive "spine" that provides haptic "clicks" as you slide your finger.
- **AI Integration**: A dedicated "Smart Action" haptic button that triggers agency-specific agent workflows (e.g., "Analyze current screen").
