# Project Ontology: The Intelligent Mouse (Project 'Aeon')

## 1. Product Essence (The 'What')
- **Seamless Ergonomics**: A shape that feels like an extension of the hand, not a tool.
- **Invisible Intelligence**: Sensors and haptics that anticipate user needs without complex buttons.
- **Sculptural Minimalism**: A form-factor that looks like a piece of art on the desk.

## 2. Design Language
- **Materials**: Matte ceramic, recycled aluminum, and silk-touch fabric.
- **Palette**: Monochromatic shades (Obsidian, Alabaster, Titanium).
- **Interaction**: Gesture-based scrolling, no visible mechanical wheels.

## 3. Innovative Edge
- **Adaptive Resistance**: Haptic feedback that changes based on the software being used (e.g., precise clicks for CAD, smooth glide for browsing).
- **Auto-charging**: Long-range magnetic resonance charging.
